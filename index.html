                    This wasn't an easy task. I had to watch tons of Youtube videos to equip
                    myself with all the knowledge backed behind this article. After a full day
                    of watching videos, i had the necessary information to write the code for 
                    a very basic webpage. I think we all know the "Hello World" approach that 
                    most Youtube creators use to teach us youngings now learning the whole thing.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    After i had gained this knowledge on how everything works out, I deciced to 
                    put this into practice. I learnt the structure, the basic tags needed, and a 
                    few trics here and there. Some of which I am using for this project now. It 
                    took a while to be able to grasp the whole concept of webpage coding though but
                    it was all worth it

                    Equipping myself with html basics was tiresome, but as we all know, a web developper
                    does not use only html to write codes. CSS code is needed to style the webpage to look 
                    appealing and decorative, and javascript is also needed to make the webpage more 
                    communicative with the user. As I type my Progress as my project right now, i have understood
                    the basics of CSS which is what I will use to style this current webpage. I cannot say 
                    I am done learning both Html and CSS codes, but I can surely say i have learnt enough
                    to put to use to get a good score on this project.<br>
                    I really enjoyed this journey and I am going to continue and make sure I get the fundamentals 
                    of javascript also and be able to make an Original Website of my own
